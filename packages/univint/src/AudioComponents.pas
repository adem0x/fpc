    @header AudioComponent

	@discussion
	
    This file defines a collection of APIs that are designed to be used when finding and opening
    audio components (such as audio units, audio codecs, and audio file components).
    
    Traditionally, the Component Manager has been used for the registration, discovery, and
    packaging of these loadable code modules. However, this may not always be the case. In order
    to provide an API that will be supported going forward from SnowLeopard (10.6) and iPhone
    2.0, it is advised that applications use the Audio Component APIs to find and load (open)
	audio components such as audio units. 
	
    The type "AudioComponent" or "AudioComponentInstance" should be seen and used as a distinct
    type from the Component Manager types of "Component" and "ComponentInstance". It is not the
    case that it is safe to assume a direct cast is compatible between this type and the other.

    The AudioComponent APIs provide a general, and mostly complete service for doing the basic
    task of finding and using audio components. If however, you find that you need functionality
    that is not provided by this API that was previously supported by the Component Manager then
    you should use the ComponentMgr APIs exclusively to find and open the Component Manager
    components. In other words, you should not assume that an audio component instance is always
    interchangeable with the existing ComponentInstance type.
    
    
    Beginning with Mac OS X 10.7, AudioComponents can be registered and used directly without
    involving the Component Manager. The system scans certain directories for bundles with names
    ending in ".audiocomp" or ".component" (the latter permits registering plug-ins in a single
    bundle with both the Component Manager and the Audio Component system). These directories
    are scanned non-recursively:
    
        ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components
        /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components
        /System/Library/Components

    Bundles' Info.plist dictionaries should contain an "AudioComponents" item whose value
    is an array of dictionaries, e.g.

        <key>AudioComponents</key>
        <array>
            <dict>
                <key>type</key>

                <key>version</key>
                <integer>12345</integer>
                <key>factoryFunction</key>
                <string>AUExampleFactory</string>
                
                <!-- An AudioComponent is sandbox safe -->
                
                <key>sandboxSafe</key>
                <true/>
                
                <!-- or it can describe it's resource usage -->

                    <array>
                        <string>CustomUserClient1</string>
                        <string>CustomUserClient2</string>
                    </array>
                    <key>mach-lookup.global-name</key>
                    <array>
                        <string>MachServiceName1</string>
                        <string>MachServiceName2</string>
                    </array>
                    <key>network.client</key>
                    <true/>
                    <key>temporary-exception.files.all.read-write</key>
                    </true>
                </dict>
            </dict>
        </array>

    The type, subtype and manufacturer keys correspond to the OSType fields of the 
    AudioComponentDescription structure. They can be strings if they are 4 ASCII characters; 
    otherwise they must be 32-bit integers.
    
    The "factoryFunction" is the name of a AudioComponentFactoryFunction in the bundle's binary.
    
    The "sandboxSafe" key is used to indicate whether or not an AudioComponent can be loaded
    directly into a sandboxed process. This key is reflected in the componentFlags field of the the
    AudioComponentDescription for the AudioComponent with the constant, kAudioComponentFlag_SandboxSafe.
    Note that if this key is not present, it is assumed that the AudioComponent is not sandbox safe.
    
    The "resourceUsage" key describes the system resources used by an AudioComponent that is not
    sandobox safe. The keys for this dictionary are described below. If the "sandboxSafe" key is
    true, this dictionary should not be included.
    
    The "iokit.user-client" key is a "resourceUsage" key that describes the IOKit user-client
    objects the AudioComponent will open. It is an array of the user-clients' class names.
    
    The "mach-lookup.global-name" key is a "resourceUsage" key that describes the mach services the
    AudioComponent needs to connect to. It is an array of the names of the services. Note that these
    services can be direct mach services found via bootstrap_look_up() or XPC services found via
    xpc_connection_create_mach_service().
    
    The "network.client" key is a "resourceUsage" key that indicates that the AudioComponent will
    receive data from the network.
    
    The "temporary-exception.files.all.read-write" key is a "resourceUsage" key that indicates that
    the AudioComponent needs arbitrary access to the file system. This is for backward compatibility
    for AudioComponents that have not yet adopted the usage of security scope bookmarks and/or the
    usage of the standard file dialog for discovering, accessing and storing persistent references
    to files on the file system. In a future OS release, this key will not be supported.
    
    Note that a sandbox safe AudioComponent can function correctly in even the most severely
    sandboxed process. This means that the process will have curtailed or no access to common system
    resources like the file system, device drivers, the network, and communication with other
    processes.
    
    When instantiating a sandbox unsafe AudioComponent in a sandboxed process, the system evaluates
    the "resourceUsage" information against the restrictions the process is under. If the
    "resourceUsage" will not violate those restrictions, the AudioComponent will be instantiated and
    can be used as normal. Note that the system will set kAudioComponentFlag_SandboxSafe in the
    AudioComponentDescription in this case.
    
    If the "resourceUsage" information includes things that can't be accessed from the process and
    the process has the entitlement, "com.apple.security.temporary-exception.audio-unit-host", the
    system will ask the user whether or not it is acceptable for the process to open the unsafe
    AudioComponent. If the user says yes, the system will suspend the process's sandbox and allow
    the unsafe AudioComponent to be opened and used.

	@typedef		AudioComponent
	@abstract		The type used to represent a class of particular audio components
    @discussion     An audio component is usually found through a search and is then uniquely
                    identified by the triple of an audio component's type, subtype and
                    manufacturer.
					
					It can have properties associated with it (such as a name, a version).
					
                    It is then used as a factory (like a class in an object-oriented programming
                    language) from which to create particular instances. The instances are used
                    to do the actual work.
					
					For example:
                    'aufx', 'dely', 'appl' describes the digital delay, audio unit effect from
                    Apple, Inc. You can find this component through searching explicitly for the
                    audio component that matches this pattern (this is an unique identifier -
                    there is only one match to this triple ID). Then once found, the Apple delay
                    effect audio unit can be created from its audio component and used to apply
                    that effect to an audio signal. While the audio component is a singleton,
                    you can of course create as many instances of a given audio component that
                    you need to do the work you need to do.

                    A special note: While on the desktop this is typedef'd to a
                    ComponentInstanceRecord *, you should not assume that this will always be
                    compatible and usable with Component Manager calls.
