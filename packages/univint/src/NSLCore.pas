    If notifier is NULL, then the NSLManager will assume that the request is made synchronously.  This
    should only be used while in a separate thread, so that the client app can still process events, etc.
    
    contextPtr is a void* which is passed as the contextPtr argument when the notifier is called.  
    
    upon exit:
    1) ref will contain a pointer to a NSLRequestRef which must be passed to all other functions
    which require a NSLRequestRef.
    2) infoPtr will point to a newly created ClientAsycnInfoPtr which will be disposed by the manager when the search is completed
    NOTE: Only one search can be running at a time per clientRef.
