	    The DriverGestaltVMOptionsResponse is returned by a disk driver in response to a
	    kdgVMOptions Driver Gestalt request. This allows a disk driver to tell VM a few
	    things about a disk drive. For example:
	    
	    ¥ A drive that should never be in the page fault path should return kAllowVMNoneMask.
	      Examples of this are drives that have manual eject buttons that are not disabled by
	      software, drives with very slow throughput, or drives that depend on
	      a network connection.
	    ¥ A drive that should never be written to but is safe for read-only file mapping
	      should return kAllowVMReadOnlyMask. Examples of this are WORM drives where each write
	      eats write-once space on the disk and CD-ROM drives which are read-only media.
	    ¥ A drive that should allow VM to create its main backing store file should return
	      kAllowVMReadWriteMask. Examples of this are fast read/write drives that don't allow
	      manual eject and don't use a network connection.
	    
	    A disk driver must look at the ioVRefNum field of the DriverGestaltParam to determine
	    what disk drive this call is for. This is a per-drive call, not a per-driver call.
	    
	    The only three valid responses to kdgVMOptions at this time are kAllowVMNoneMask,
	    kAllowVMReadOnlyMask, and kAllowVMReadWriteMask (i.e., setting only kAllowVMWriteBit
	    is not valid).
	    
	    Important: All bits not defined here are reserved and should be set to zero until
	    they are defined for a specific purpose.
	    
	    The kdcVMOptions Driver Configure _Control call provides the ability to change a driver's
	    response to kdgVMOptions Driver Gestalt requests. A driver should return controlErr if
	    it doesn't want to provide the ability to change the kdgVMOptions response. If a driver
	    supports the kdcVMOptions Driver Configure _Control call, but is asked to set an option bit
	    that it doesn't support (for example, if a read-only device is asked to set the kAllowVMWriteBit),
	    it should return paramErr.

	kdgGetDriveAddInfo/kdcAddDriveWithInfo is used by the Alias Manager to
	assist in the  remounting of container files. eg DiskCopy.  The driver
	can use it to store whatever information it needs to remount a drive
	For example the Volume name and FileID..  What is in here is entirely 
	dependant on the driver, we never interpret it.
	
	This extension to the Alias Manager works as such:
	   
	When creating an alias 
	----------------------
	    
	If driver supports Driver Gestalt, the Alias Mgr calls the driver with a 
	 kdgGetDriveAddInfo DriverGestalt request. 
	        
	Inputs to DriverGestalt:
	    ioVRefNum   = drive number
	    ioCRefNum   = driver refNum
	    csCode      = kDriverGestaltCode
	    driverGestaltSelector = kdgGetDriveAddInfo
	 
	If the driver supports kdgGetDriveAddInfo, it returns a pointer to the drive's
	drive  information record (DriverGestaltDriveAddInfoResponse*) in the 
	driverGestaltResponse field and returns noErr. 
	
	  The memory used by the DriverGestaltDriveAddInfoResponse and it's pointed 
	to data, must be previously held by the disk driver with HoldMemory. 
	        
	If the driver doesn't support kdgGetDriveAddInfo,  it returns statusErr.
	
	If noErr, the Alias Mgr stores the drive information record in the alias record 
	(the length of the drive information record data is in the length field).
	
	
	When resolving an alias:
	------------------------
	
	If driver supports Driver Gestalt, the Alias Mgr holds the drive information record 
	in the alias with HoldMemory and then calls the driver with a kdcAddDriveWithInfo
	DriverConfigure request. 
	        
	Inputs to DriverConfigure:
	    ioCRefNum   = driver refNum
	    csCode      = kDriverConfigureCode
	    driverGestaltSelector = pointer to DriverGestaltDriveAddInfoResponse
	            
	
	If the driver supports kdcAddDriveWithInfo, it uses the information in the drive 
	information record to add a drive to the drive queue. If the drive is added,
	the driver returns noErr and returns the drive number in the ioVRefNum field of 
	the parameter block. 
	
	If the drive cannot be added  (but kdcAddDriveWithInfo is supported), the driver 
	returns nsDrvErr. 
	
	If the driver doesn't  support kdcAddDriveWithInfo, it returns controlErr. 
	
	If noErr is returned, but the data in the  drive information record is not 
	up-to-date, the driver should set driveInfoChangedBit in the options field of the 
	drive information record. 
	
	If driveInfoInteractBit in the options field  is set at input, the driver 
	may perform user interaction to mount the drive.
	
	If noErr, the Alias Mgr tries to resolve the alias the rest of the way.
