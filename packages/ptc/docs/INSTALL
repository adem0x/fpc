The supported platforms are Linux (on IA-32 and AMD64), Windows and DOS.
FreeBSD and NetBSD compiles and runs fine on the SourceForge compilefarm, but
I haven't tested it on a local machine, so any feedback (+patches) is welcome.
(At least the basic XImage mode works, XShm and dga are not tested since they
need to run on the same machine as the X server, so I can't test them on the
SourceForge compilefarm.)

You need Free Pascal Compiler version 2.0.0. Since there's no DOS version of
2.0.0, you need 1.0.10 if you are going to use the DOS version of the library.
Please note that DOS is the only platform where the 1.0.10 compiler is
supported.

 - Compiling the library:
Before starting make sure the FPCDIR environment variable is set correctly.
For example: (windows, fpc version 2.0.0, default install dir)

  set FPCDIR=c:\fpc\2.0.0

To compile the library type:

  fpcmake -r
  make

Then you can do:

  make examples

And then try to run the programs in the demos/ and examples/ dirs.

If compiling the library fails, make sure you're using the GNU make and not
some other make! (e.g. GNU make is called 'gmake' on FreeBSD and NetBSD)

'make -v' should report:
  GNU Make version x.xx.x, ... etc. :)

On Windows and DOS this is the 'make' that comes with Free Pascal.
