It is against the Apple license to distribute even derivatives of the iPhone headers so you must build them manually from the Objective-C headers using the parser.

Please note you must download the iPhone SDK (2GB+) from Apple's website (https://developer.apple.com/iphone), which contains the headers. Once the files are installed make sure the following SDK is available at this location:

/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS2.2.1.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/UIKit.framework/Headers

1) cd to the directory which contains parser.php
2) php parser.php -iphone -root="/usr/local/lib/fpc/2.5.1/units/i386-darwin/cocoaint/src"
	
	Note: -root is the path to the directory which contains the base appkit and foundation folders. These folders come in the FPC distribution with some hand parsed headers and the master include units for each framework.

3) Finally some handing coding must be done:

	1) UITextInputTraits in UITextInputTraits.inc must be changed to UITextInputTraitsProtocol.

	UITextField.inc(80,32) Error: Identifier not found "UITextInputTraits"
	UITextField.inc(81,39) Error: Identifier not found "UITextInputTraits"
