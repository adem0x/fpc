1) "cd" to the directory which contains parser.php

2) To see the scripts usage use the command:

	php parser.php

3) To parse the entire AppKit and Foundation frameworks use this command:

	php parser.php -objp -all -out=/objp -ignore="NSGeometry.h,NSRange.h" -root="/path/to/objp"
	
	NOTE: -root is the path to the objp directory as was included in the distribution. This directory should contain the master unit objp.pas amongst other files. The files ignored are pre-parsed and corrected by hand but do contain parser errors.

4) To parse a single header use the "-header" option:
	
	php parser.php -objp -header="foundation/NSDate.h" -out=/objp -root="/path/to/objp"

5) The parser is still not perfect and where parsing the all frameworks you must correct these details by hand.
	
	- Errors:
	1) NSWorkspace.h has a duplicate NSWorkspaceLaunchAllowingClassicStartup constant
	2) NSObjcRuntime.h contains a bad external function:
		function __attribute__(: (format(__NSString__; : 1; : 2))): void NSLog(NSStringRef *format, ...); cdecl; external name '__attribute__';
	3) NSZone.h contains 2 function parser errors:
		function NSAllocateCollectable(size: culong; options: culong): void *__strong; cdecl; external name 'NSAllocateCollectable';
		function NSReallocateCollectable(var ptr: Pointer; size: culong; options: culong): void *__strong; cdecl; external name 'NSReallocateCollectable';
	4) NSATSTypesetter.h needs to use NSObject for the super class until the internal error can be fixed or the class NSTypesetter parsed

	- General notes:
	1) NSObject.h is parsed for the merged category methods that should be inserted manually into the real root class
	2) NSRange.h was ignored because it contains custom code and can be maintained by hand very easily
	3) NSGeometry.h was ignored because it contains many parsing errors and custom code, do this by hand for now.
