CFNetServices
Network Services is composed of two objects, a Network Service and
a Network Service Browser.  A Network Service represents a single
point service on the network.  Associated with a service is its name,
type of service, domain, port, and possibly protocol specific information
(for legacy protocols).  Services can be registered and resolved.
Registering a service advertises the service on the network, so other
computers can use the service.  Resolving a service performs a network
lookup in order to find the computer which has registered the service.
Lookup is contained by the services name, type of service, and the domain.
The port and address of the registered service will be returned.  Services
can be created or discovered.

Discovery of services takes place through the use of the Network Service
Browser.  Given a domain and a service type, the browser will search out
those services on the network.  The returned services can then be resolved
and then used.

Service type values are keywords as registered with IANA.  A list of values
may be retrieved from their web site at
<http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers>.

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Sets up the service to be used in asynchronous mode. 
 *    Notification of registration failure or resolution completion
 *    will occur through the given callback.  Once the client is set,

 *    caller's responsibility to ensure that at least one of the

 *    before calling CFNetServiceRegister or CFNetServiceResolve,

 *    client could be set.
 *  
 *  Mac OS X threading:

 *    
 *    clientCB:
 *      Function pointer will be called upon registration failure or
 *      upon resolution completion.  In the case of resolution, this

 *      address for a service.  Passing NULL will remove the client

 *  Result:
 *    Returns FALSE if the client could not be set, TRUE otherwise.

{

 *  Discussion:
