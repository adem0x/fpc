	{	    QuickTime Music Track Event Formats:
	
	    At this time, QuickTime music tracks support 5 different event types -- REST events,
	    short NOTE events, short CONTROL events, short GENERAL events, Long NOTE events, 
	    long CONTROL events, and variable GENERAL events.
	 
	        ¥ REST Event (4 bytes/event):
	    
	            (0 0 0) (5-bit UNUSED) (24-bit Rest Duration)
	        
	        ¥ÊShort NOTE Events (4 bytes/event):
	    
	            (0 0 1) (5-bit Part) (6-bit Pitch) (7-bit Volume) (11-bit Duration)
	        
	            where:  Pitch is offset by 32 (Actual pitch = pitch field + 32)
	
	        ¥ÊShort CONTROL Events (4 bytes/event):
	    
	            (0 1 0) (5-bit Part) (8-bit Controller) (1-bit UNUSED) (1-bit Sign) (7-bit MSB) (7-bit LSB)
	                                                                         ( or 15-bit Signed Value)
	        ¥ Short GENERAL Event (4 bytes/event):
	    
	            (0 1 1) (1-bit UNUSED) (12-bit Sub-Type) (16-bit Value)
	    
	        ¥ Long NOTE Events (8 bytes/event):
	    
	            (1 0 0 1) (12-bit Part) (1-bit UNUSED) (7-bit Pitch) (1-bit UNUSED) (7-bit Volume)

	        ¥ÊLong CONTROL Event (8 bytes/event):
	        
	            (1 0 1 0) (12-bit Part) (16-bit Value MSB) 
	            (1 0) (14-bit Controller) (16-bit Value LSB)
	    
	        ¥ÊLong KNOB Event (8 bytes/event):
	    
	            (1 0 1 1) (12-bit Sub-Type) (16-bit Value MSB)
	            (1 0) (14-bit KNOB) (16-bit Value LSB)
	    
	        ¥ÊVariable GENERAL Length Events (N bytes/event):
	    
	            (1 1 1 1) (12-bit Sub-Type) (16-bit Length)
	                :
	            (32-bit Data values)
	                :
	            (1 1) (14-bit UNUSED) (16-bit Length)
	    
	            where:  Length field is the number of LONG words in the record.
	                    Lengths include the first and last long words (Minimum length = 2)
	                
	    The following event type values have not been used yet and are reserved for 
	    future expansion:
	        
	        ¥ (1 0 0 0)     (8 bytes/event)
	        ¥ (1 1 0 0)     (N bytes/event)
	        ¥ (1 1 0 1)     (N bytes/event)
	        ¥ (1 1 1 0)     (N bytes/event)
	        
	    For all events, the following generalizations apply:
	    
	        -   All duration values are specified in Millisecond units.
	        -   Pitch values are intended to map directly to the MIDI key numbers.
	        -   Controllers from 0 to 127 correspond to the standard MIDI controllers.
	            Controllers greater than 127 correspond to other controls (i.e., Pitch Bend, 
	            Key Pressure, and Channel Pressure).
