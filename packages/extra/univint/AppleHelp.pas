 *    Viewer application.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *

 *      file that is relative to the main folder of the book supplied
 *      in the bookname parameter, or 2) if bookname is NULL, a full
 *      file: URL to the file to be opened. If this parameter is NULL,
 *      then bookname must not be NULL, and is used to open the Help
 *      Viewer to the main page of Help content for the specified book.
 *    
 *    anchor:
 *      Optionally, the name of anchor tag to scroll to in the newly
 *      opened file. Can be NULL.

 *    indexing tool's preferences panel.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    bookname:
 *      Optionally, the AppleTitle of the Help book to searched. If

 *    anchor:
 *      The name of the anchor tag to look up.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An operating system result code that indicates whether the

{
 *  AHRegisterHelpBook()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Registers a book of Help content such that the book will appear
 *    in the current user's main table of contents (Help Center) in the
 *    Help Viewer application. To be used when help books reside
 *    outside of the known help folders (i.e. help books that are kept
 *    inside of application bundles).
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    appBundleRef:
 *      An FSRef pointer to the bundle within which one or more Help
 *      books is stored. This is likely an FSRef to your application's
 *      main bundle.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    An operating system result code that indicates whether all help
 *    books contained within the specified bundle were registered.
 *    Possible values: noErr, paramErr, kAHInternalErr, dirNFErr.
