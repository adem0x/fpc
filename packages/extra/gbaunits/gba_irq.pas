  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This lib is a raw porting of libgba library for gba (you can find it at
  http://www.devkitpro.org).
  
  As this is a direct port from c, I'm pretty sure that something could not work
  as you expect. I am even more sure that this code could be written better, so 
  if you think that I have made some mistakes or you have some better 
  implemented functions, let me know [francky74 (at) gmail (dot) com]
  Enjoy!
