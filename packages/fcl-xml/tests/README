Test runner for w3.org XML compliance suite
-------------------------------------------

The xmlts is intended to run the XML compliance suite from W3.org.
The suite includes 2500+ tests. It may be downloaded from
http://www.w3.org/XML/Test/xmlts20031210.zip  (approx. 1.7 mBytes)
After compiling xmlts.pp, run it with the following command line:

xmlts <path-to-xmlconf.xml> <report-filename> [-t template.xml] [-v]

Two required commandline parameters include path to test database file and report
filename. Optionally, you may specify validating mode with -v switch and report
template filename with -t (by default, 'template.xml' is used).
The test suite includes several test databases (all named 'xmlconf.xml'). There is
master database located in root dir, and several individual databases in different
subdirs.

for example, to run all tests included into the suite in non-validating mode, use:

xmlts xmlconf/xmlconf.xml myreport.html

Report is produced in xhtml format, use your favourite browser to view it.

As of 10.03.2007, the xml package does not support namespaces yet, so you might wish
to exclude namespace tests. To do this, edit xmlconf/xmlconf.xml file and comment out
two lines at the bottom which reference 'eduni-ns10' and 'eduni-ns11' testsuites.

(The last lines should look like:

    &eduni-xml11;
<!--    &eduni-ns10; -->
<!--    &eduni-ns11; -->

</TESTSUITE>
)
