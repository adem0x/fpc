  These units provides interface to Oracle Call Interface.
Object workaround (TOraDatabase etc...) is on the way.

  Unit oraclew contains some procedures and functions,
which makes usage of oraoci not so painfull... But - 
if you wanna to program in RAW OCI, you really can ;)

To compile you need oracle server installed, these units
was tested and performed on Oracle 8.0.1.5 Standard
server. One developer license of Oracle server is free
of charge...

You need to have oracle lib directory in ldpath, too,
or you can this path set in Makefile.fpc (is commented
there)

After all this, run 'make examples' and enjoy!
