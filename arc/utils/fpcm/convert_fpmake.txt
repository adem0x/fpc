The convert_all_fpmake.sh script generates the Makefile.fpc's for calling
fpmake.
It does that for all packages in sub-directories of the current directory. The
Makefile.fpc's are based on the Makefile.fpmake.template and the 
Makefile.fpmake.bs.template, the latter for packages that are needed to bootstrap the fpmkunit. Note that the fpmkunint-package is skipped by this
script, since it's Makefile.fpc is very different from the others.

For generating the utils-makefiles do:

cd utils
fpcm/convert_all_fpmake.sh -d ../../packages -p fpcm


For generating the packages-makefiles:

cd packages
../utils/fpcm/convert_all_fpmake.sh -p ../utils/fpcm
