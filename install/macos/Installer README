Welcome to Free Pascal for MPW on classic Mac OS
================================================

Please also read the general README file.

NOTE!

Free Pascal for MPW is still considered beta quality and a lot of things
are still missing. However ordinary programs should be able to compile. And
the compiler can compile itself.

Things which is not included: unit SysUtils and its dependants
IDE, GDB, FPCMake 

For documentation, please download separate.

How to install:
---------------

1. If you do not have MPW, please install MPW first.
   MPW can be downloaded for free from Apple, see web page:
     http://developer.apple.com/tools/mpw-tools/
   download at:
     ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./
   It is then recommended that you upgrade to MPW Shell 3.6b1.

2. Double click the file "INSTALL". This will launch an
   install script (via the ToolServer application, which is
   included in the MPW installation).

3. If it is the first time you install Free Pascal,
   the install script will ask where you want to create the
   FreePascal folder.

4. The installer will copy necessary files to the
   FreePascal folder, create an fpc.cfg file,
   and also add a startup script in 
   the Startup Items folder in the MPW folder.

5. Done.


What is installed ?
-------------------

1. The FreePascal folder in a nice place.

2. A file "FPC Startup" in "Startup Items" in MPW.

3. An entry in "FPC Startup" which sets the environment variable FPCDIR
   to point to the FreePascal folder.

4. An entry in "FPC Startup" which adds the :FreePascal:bin folder to 
   the Commando search path. 

5. A fpc.cfg file in :FreePascal:bin, with among others, a path to
   the runtime library (rtl).

Uninstallation
--------------

1. Delete the FreePascal folder.

2. Delete the file "FPC Startup" from the folder "Startup Items" in MPW


Tips
----

* Usage, in short: To compile e. g. hello.pp, in MPW type:
    fpc hello.pp
  And press ENTER. Done.

* If you want to compile large programs, and in particular the rtl
  or the compiler itself, please increase the memory setting of
  MPW to 50 MB and ToolServer to 30 MB.

* Note that unit Sysutils.pp is not yet ported to MacOS, thus units
  dependant on Sysutils.pp does neither work.

* To invoke the compiler you can either use the command 'ppcppc' or 'fpc'.
  Fpc is a wrapper script which simply call 'ppcppc'

* Use mac style search path's.

* Limited debugging with Power Mac Debugger can be done. To enable this,
  compile the program with the -g switch. Then debugging at source level,
  with stepping etc, can be done. However variables cannot be inspected.

Inner workings
--------------

FreePascal for MPW is an MPW tool. When FreePascal wants to assemble
and link, it calls PPCAsm and PPCLink, via ToolServer.
