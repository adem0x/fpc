The Free Pascal Compiler for Debian
----------------------

The source tree was checked out from CVS at cvs.freepascal.org with
 'cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.freepascal.org:/FPC/CVS -z3 co -r %{fpccvstag} fpc'
 (password: 'cvs')

The Debian Build Directory was created with 'make debcopy' and then 
duplicated to .orig before 'dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot' was run.

Only PDF docs are built as shipped. You may want to make the HTML files with
tex4ht by yourself and eventually adapt the doc-base file. Building the
documents requires at least the following values in /etc/texmf/texmf.conf:
save_size = 10000

To create a new config file for fpc (/etc/fpc.cfg) use the command:
 /usr/lib/fpc/%{fpcversion}/samplecfg /usr/lib/fpc/%{fpcversion}
However, you should be aware that said file (/etc/fpc.cfg) is
declared as a conffile since version 1.0.2.

And, yes - this is a i386/amd64/powerpc/sparc only package currently.
