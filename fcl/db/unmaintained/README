Here you can find some unmaintained database-units. They will be 
removed from fpc in the near future, so please do not use this
units in new projects.

The interbase, odbc and mysql components in here are replaced
by the sqldb package. 

The sqlitedataset unit is replaced by the sqliteds units.

The ddg units were only made to test the DB main classes, since
there was no good TDataset descendents to test with. At this 
moment there are enough descendents to test with, which makes
these units obsolete.

Note that odbc and sqlite aren't even in the makefile, since
they won't compile.
