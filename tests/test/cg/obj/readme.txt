These subdirectories contain the object files for ctest.c compiled with
their respective GCC compilers.

Each time a new test is done on a compiler, it should be put in the
following list, so as to determine which compiler versions can be
used by Free Pascal for interfacing to C modules.

Tested compilers (OK)
---------------------
go32v2 : 2.95.3 20010315/djgpp (release)
Win32 :  2.95.3-5 (cygwin special)
Amiga :  GCC 2.91.66

    can be used with FPC, but at least ctest.c compiles)
